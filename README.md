 An implementation of Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) protocol, presented in the form of a simulator, including 2 versions:
### 1. rdt3.0
 The Alternating-Bit-Protocol (ABP) version, A as the sender and B as the receiver in this implementation.
### 2. GBN
 A Go-Back-to-N version with both ACK and NAK, A as the sender and B as the receiver.

#### Here are the [Source Code](https://github.com/zzyking/RDT-implementation/tree/main/src) and [Logs](https://github.com/zzyking/RDT-implementation/tree/main/data)
